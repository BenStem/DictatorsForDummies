			 				<p>The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan. As soon as you sacrifice this slogan and try to be many-sided, the effect will piddle away, for the crowd can neither digest nor retain the material offered.
				</p><p>In the Reich's early years, anti-Jewish regulations were drawn up by a Nazi bureaucracy that included both radical and moderate anti-Semites. None of the bureaucrats had any moral qualms about being anti-Semitic. However, the moderates were concerned with foreign reaction and the possible disruptive impact of anti-Jewish prohibitions on Germany's still-fragile economy.

				<p>If outvoting them takes longer than outshooting them, at least the results will be guaranteed by their own Constitution! Any lawful process is slow. But sooner or later we shall have a majority – and after that Germany

				<p>Every successful dictator should possess the qualities of using persuading people, using force and slowly approaching problems. A good dictator has to persuade people to make the people think that he should lead the country, so he can get power. Then the dictator has to use force to get people what he wants. Problems that come up have to slowly be taken care of. If the problem is attempted to be done quickly, more problems arise, like people turning against the dictator. This is what Hitler did to become a great leader.

			<h1>Choosing the right environment for Hitler
			</h1>
			<h3 style="color: white;">Ben Pauka</h3>
			<p>	Germany had many problems that made a good environment for someone to overthrow the government. Adolf Hitler used these weaknesses to become dictator. He was angry for all the social and economical problems after World War I. Since there were many problems, Hitler quickly got promoted to ranks after becoming a socialist. His propaganda persuaded everyone. Hitler had a good environment to become dictator because of economic ruin, unemployment and resentment.
			</p>
			<p>	Economic ruin was one of the many problems germany had after World War I. The Germans got defeated in World War I. As a result, they had to pay in damage from the war. Germany also had to pay after the Treaty of Versailles, which made them owe money to the allied countries. Boundaries of Germany also decreased. France sent troops to the Ruhr valley into the mines to take money and wealth. As a result, steel production fell by 10,000 tons. Getting defeated in World War I, the Treaty of Versailles and the Battle of the Ruhr made Germany an economical disaster.
			</p>
			<p>	Thus there was unemployment. After World War I, Germany suffered from steep price inflation and its currency became almost worthless. The mark-dollar ratio rose from 4.2 marks to one dollar to 4.2 trillion marks for one dollar. marks because useless to other countries. The United States demanded to receive repayment from Europe, including Germany for damages and costs, which led to unemployment in Germany. Companies could not afford to hire workers. In the 1930s, 33% of the population was unemployed. In this unstable and uncertain environment, Hitler rose to power by persuading the people that he could fix unemployment.
			</p>
			<p>	The Germans resented the Treaty of Versailles, which was too harsh. The Germans started protests to change the Treaty of Versailles. Even though some people the United States and Britain felt that the treaty was too harsh, the terms of the treaty were never softened. The treaty took away a large portion of Germany’s territory, including very valuable industrial areas. German landowners lost property. The treaty also limited germany to a small military force. Germany only had 100,000 men in the army. Hitler took advantage of the situation by promising his people that he would build a strong army to reclaim Germany’s territory and to make Germany strong and proud again.
			</p>
			<p>	In the early 1930s, the German People were suffering from economic ruin, unemployment and resentment from the harsh terms of the treaty of versailles. Hitler took advantage of this period of suffering by promising the german people that he could solve the economic problems, get rid of unemployment and make Germany strong again. By doing all this, Hitler got elected to lead the country, and quickly to become a dictator.
